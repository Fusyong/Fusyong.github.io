<h2 id="_1">翻译说明</h2>
<p>Bukowski著，黄复雄翻译。
翻译底本是<em>LOVE IS A DOG FROM HELL</em>(1997), Ecco 2003年第一版。
大概于2012年8月前译出初稿，2013年10月前做过一次修改。本次逐一读校，分批发出。
目前仍是未定稿，尤有未作注的问题。推说来日方长吧。</p>
<p>这个诗集可能是普通美国读者评价最高的（参见<a href="https://bukowski.net/bookranking/">bukowski.net的投票榜</a>），
而<a href="http://blog.xiiigame.com/bu-kao-si-ji-shi-ji-dan-zui-qin-ru-ji-gu-zhi-dao-shou-zhi-di-xie.html">《弹醉琴》</a>获得中等评价。
但根据我个人的感受，前者对中国读者的吸引力不如后者，也许因为后者更粗粝，因此更符合中国读者对“布考斯基”的期待吧。</p>
