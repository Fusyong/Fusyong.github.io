<p>// 我是新学Phaser，该怎么做？</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: 2018-05-17</em></p>
<p>The key to learning game dev / Phaser is to <em>just build stuff</em>, it doesn't
need to be good or even complete. The more you program the more you know
and the easier it is to make what you imagine real.
// 学游戏开发/Phaser的关键是_只管多多地做东西_……</p>
<p>That said, if having a list of things that help you get started is useful
we've compiled a bunch of introductory guides. They're ordered based on how
much you're expected to already know and we're always happy to take
suggestions about new stuff that should be added to the list.
// 我们已经编制了一串入门指导的清单……按学习次序排列……</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/index">Getting Started</a>—This introduces you to the basics of how to run your game and gives provides a super simple game you can create.</li>

<li><a href="https://gamedevacademy.org/phaser-3-tutorial/">How to create a game</a>—This is a similar slice of information
   as <em>Making your first game</em> but covers enough different information that it's
   worth reading through as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jdotrjs/phaser-guides/blob/master/Basics/Part1.md">How to structure your code</a>—This isn't about how to program
   exactly but talks a little bit about how to organize your project so that it's
   easy to keep building on what you've got. Optional reading but I feel it's an
   important bit of information.</li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/community">Ask for help</a>—Get involved in the community! It's dangerous
   to go alone, take a friend, and don't be afraid to ask for help.</li>

<h2 id="is-there-a-scalemanager-in-v3">Is there a ScaleManager in v3?</h2>
<p>// Phaser3有ScaleManager（Phaser2的类，屏幕适配用）吗？</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: 2018-08-13</em></p>
<p>Not yet, but one is in the works and planned for Phaser 3.15! It won't be as complex as
the one in Phaser CE, but should do a good job in helping you scale your game to fill
the entire screen.</p>
<p>In the mean time it's not too bad to roll your own solution. We even have some examples
- <a href="http://phaser3.danny-t.co.uk/scaling/">Example page</a> from DannyT includes functional examples built using
  some of the principles discussed in the following links
- <a href="https://gist.github.com/AleBles/697d703e89eecae5a350c1453a32861e">this gist</a> from Str1ngS bundles some scaling functionality into a class and
  demonstratse how to hook it into your game; the <code>orientation</code> and <code>content</code> references
  are HTML elements in yoru page that you cane use to implement "wrong orientation" overlays
  as described in <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/master-screen-orientation-html5-101517371">this post</a>
- <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/33206-scalemanagershow_all/">this thread</a> includes a (Haxe) code sample from community member Antriel
- <a href="https://codepen.io/samme/pen/paOjMO">a codepen</a> sample linked from Samme includes another promising solution

<h2 id="tell-me-the-story-of-phaser-v3-and-typescript">Tell me the story of Phaser v3 and Typescript</h2>
<p>// 跟我说说Phaser3和Typescript。</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: 2018-05-08</em></p>
<p>Typescript defs are now available at <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs/tree/master/typescript">photonstorm/phaser3-docs</a>. That file
is the one you want to use. Previously, <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/3224">phaser#3224</a> was the official
Phaser tracking ticket.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-guide-to-porting-my-v2ce-project-to-v3">Is there a guide to porting my v2/CE project to v3?</h2>
<p>// Phaser2/CE迁移到3，有指导吗？</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: 2018-03-14</em></p>
<p>Not yet. There is a partial guide in <a href="https://madmimi.com/p/a022cb">Newsletter issue 116</a> in the
section named <em>Moving from Phaser 2 to Phaser 3 (Part 1)</em>. Part 2 is in
<a href="https://madmimi.com/p/ff68db">issue 118</a>.</p>
<p>The API is similar enough that you will feel comfortable once you've figured
out where things live but there is no mechanical solution to making a CE
project run in v3. In that way it's definitely possible to make the jump for
an existing project.</p>
<p>That said, enough essential things are different (no <code>ScaleManager</code> yet,
<code>Scene</code> works differently than <code>State</code>, etc.) that it takes a little thinking. 
The work to describe how all the old CE concepts map into v3 is planned
but currently incomplete.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-use-phaser-ce-or-v3">Should I use Phaser CE or v3?</h2>
<p>// 我该用PhaserCE还是Phaser3？</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: 2018-02-10 / 2018-10-28</em></p>
<p>tl;dr: One of our members made a video talking about deciding whether or not
to use v3: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St_tPsG0pX0">go watch it</a> (thanks Wild)! For production stuff, Phaser CE
is still a good choice, but if you're learning Phaser and/or feeling adventurous
then v3 is a pretty good bet, and it's becoming better every day.</p>
<p>That video was recorded Feb 10th. Since then we (the community at large) have
leveled up several times about how well we understand and how much we've
experimented with v3. Tutorials are beginning to emerge and several patch
releases have appeared fixing bugs and adding previosly missing features.
Broadly speaking getting into V3 is much easier than it was but still seeing
quite a bit of development. If you're adventurous and willing to dig v3 is a
good place to be. The API is cleaner than CE and it's definitely the future of
Phaser so learning it to start with is probably a good move.</p>
<p>If you need something exceptionally stable and battle worn that you can take
into production <em>right now</em> then you probably still want to stick with CE for
the time being. By the numbers most deployed Phaser games are CE which means
more time has been spent understanding it's edge cases. You're not going to
see as many bugs or API changes than working off V3 but you're also not going
to see any improvements.</p>
<h2 id="my-game-behaves-inconsistentstops-running-while-in-the-background">My game behaves inconsistent/stops running while in the background</h2>
<p>// 我的游戏后台运行有问题/停止</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: 2018-10-26</em></p>
<p>Modern browsers place several restrictions on websites that run in the background. This usually means background tabs, but can also influence windows that are unfocused or partly hidden by another window. When in the background, requestAnimationFrame is not triggered, and it may be throttled when the website is unfocused. This means that Phaser's update loop won't run. Additionally, timers in background tabs may run less frequently than they normally would. Chrome only executes timers once per second, while Firefox has similar policies. The timers may be throttled even more in some cases. Playing audio or using websockets are usually an exception to this additional throttling.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-post-code">How do I post code?</h2>
<p>// 我怎么粘贴代码？</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: 2018-11-03</em></p>
<p>If you have a small bit of code (less than about 20-30 lines) to share the easiest approach
is using the formatting support built into Discord. This means using <code>```javascript</code> on
a line by itself then entering your code:</p>
<p><img alt="code format sample" src="https://i.imgur.com/OzQ4KtS.png"/></p>
<p>If you have a longer or multi-file segment of code creating a new <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a>
or <a href="https://codepen.io/">codepen</a> is better.</p></div>
